```python
# Execute commands
process_id = await jarvis.subsystems['kernel'].execute_command("your command")

# Get system status
status = jarvis.get_status()

# Create automation
workflow_id = await jarvis.subsystems['automation'].create_workflow(
    name="My Workflow",
    triggers=[{"type": "schedule", "config": {"cron": "0 2 * * *"}}],
    actions=[{"type": "execute_command", "parameters": {"command": "backup.sh"}}]
)

# Get system metrics
metrics = jarvis.subsystems['interface'].get_system_metrics()
```
